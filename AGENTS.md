# Agent Development Standards for this Repository

This document outlines the coding, review, and workflow standards for all AI coding agents (including Google's Jules and Anthropic's Claude) contributing to this repository. All agents must strictly adhere to these guidelines to ensure consistency, quality, and effective collaboration.

## 1. Code Style

- **Consistency is Key:** Code should be consistent with the style of the existing codebase.
- **Language-Specific Guidelines:**
    - **Python:** Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for all Python code. Use `ruff` for linting and formatting where available.
    - **Java:** Follow the [Google Java Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html).
    - **JavaScript/TypeScript:** Follow the [Google JavaScript Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html). Use Prettier for formatting.
- **Clarity and Readability:** Write clear, self-documenting code. Add comments for complex logic.

## 2. Tests

- **Unit Tests are Mandatory:** All new features or bug fixes must be accompanied by unit tests.
- **Test Coverage:** Strive for high test coverage. Do not let coverage decrease.
- **Run All Tests:** Before submitting any change, run all relevant tests (unit, integration) to ensure no regressions have been introduced. The command to run tests can usually be found in the project's `README.md` or a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file.

## 3. Pull Request (PR) Checklist

Before submitting a pull request, ensure the following steps have been completed:

1.  **Code Changes are Complete:** The solution addresses the given problem or feature request.
2.  **Tests are Added/Updated:** New tests are included, and existing tests pass.
3.  **All Automated Checks Pass:** Run all linters, static analysis, and tests successfully.
4.  **Self-Review:** Perform a self-review of the changes to catch any obvious errors.
5.  **Descriptive Title and Message:** The PR has a clear, descriptive title and a commit message that explains the "what" and "why" of the change.
6.  **No Build Artifacts:** Verify that no build artifacts (e.g., `__pycache__`, `.pyc`, `dist/`, `build/`) are included in the commit.

## 4. Troubleshooting

- **Read the Logs:** Carefully examine error messages and logs. They often contain the solution.
- **Verify Dependencies:** If you encounter dependency issues, check `requirements.txt`, `package.json`, or other dependency management files. Ensure all required dependencies are installed.
- **Isolate the Problem:** Try to create a minimal reproducible example to isolate the root cause of an issue.

## 5. Agent Learnings Log

This section records key learnings, non-obvious solutions, and repository-specific procedures to improve future agent performance.

### **Date: 2025-11-13**

-   **Learning:** Build artifacts (`__pycache__` directories and `.pyc` files in Python projects) must not be included in commits. They are generated by the runtime and can cause issues in version control.
-   **Procedure:** Before submitting, always run a `git status` or list the files to ensure only source code is being committed. Use a `.gitignore` file to automatically exclude these artifacts. I have added a `.dockerignore` file in my previous work which can be a good reference.

### **Date: 2025-11-13**

-   **Learning:** As an AI agent, I have limitations in resolving merge conflicts. I cannot pull the latest changes from a target branch (e.g., `main` or `develop`) to resolve conflicts on my feature branch.
-   **Procedure:** When a pull request has merge conflicts, I will notify the user that the conflicts must be resolved by a human developer with the necessary repository permissions. My work is ready to be merged once the conflicts are resolved.
